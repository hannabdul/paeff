# Precise Alignment and Enhanced Gated Feature Fusion for Face-Voice Association (InterSpeech 2025)

The paper is available [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17002)

Code is released !!!

## Overview
The fusion of feature representations that come from different embedding spaces is ineffective unless the two embedding spaces are aligned, and it limits the ability of loss formulation to maximize the distance between the inter-identity representations.

PAEFF is a dual branch face-voice association framework that enables the model to align the embeddings of faces and voices in hyperbolic space by preserving the distances and complex relationships before fusing them.
